# 100-days-of-python
Following 100 Days of Python Course from Udemy and AppBrewery

##Daily Log
Logging each day and what was learned and what I made.

##Day 1
Today was learning print function, variables, input, and string concatination. At the end of the day I built a Band Name Generator that askes for your hometown and a pet name putting them together to get a possible band name. Might revisit later to add other inputs and randomize the answers.
